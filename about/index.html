      Hello stranger, my name is Max, I am <span class="age">...</span> years old and I work as a frontend &amp; backend web-developer based in Mayence, Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was born 1993 in Koblenz, a city in the east-west of Germany. While growing up I moved a lot between small villages near my birth town and Frankfurt am Main. After my graduation I completed a 3 years education at a small web agency, it was all about websites and webshops. While improving the basics of HTML and CSS I created my first website in 2005, but I really started to do professional web-design in 2009. In the meantime I mastered my skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP. Almost all my work is responsive and compatible to a lot of devices and platforms. My goal is to write clean source code, create designs that speak for themselves and write texts which are worth reading. To see more of my skill-set, scroll down.

      In 2013 I finished my education and moved to Mayence. Since then I've been working for a small web agency in the middle of the city called <a href="http://www.opoloo.com" target="_blank">Opoloo</a>.

      Apart from my addiction to the internet I am also a speedcuber. What is that? It's solving a Rubik's Cube in a matter of seconds. I participate at competitions all around Europe and sometimes worldwide. My current best time for a single solve at an official competition is <i>19.18 seconds</i>. My personal best at home is <i>16.09 seconds</i> You can see all of my official result on my <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011BOLL01" target="_blank">WCA profile</a>.
