      Hello stranger, my name is Max and I am a frontend &amp; backend web-developer based in Mayence, Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was born in 1993 in Koblenz, a city in the east-west of Germany. While growing up I moved a lot between small villages near my birth town and Frankfurt am Main. After my graduation at school I made a 3 years education at a small web agency, it was all about websites and webshops. While this time I mastered my skills at a couple of programming languages.
    </p>

      2013 I finished my education and moved to Mayence. Since then I work for a small web agency in the middle of the city called <a href="http://www.opoloo.com" target="_blank">Opoloo</a>.
