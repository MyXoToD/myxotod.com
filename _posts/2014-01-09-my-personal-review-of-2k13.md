I feel inspired by [Kevin](http://kevingimbel.com/how-i-got-employed/) to write an article about my life in 2013. A lot of things happened and I can't wait to wrap them together and tell you.

### January
2013 probably started with the most amazing party I ever had in the middle of Berlin. Kevin, Coery, my girlfriend and I visited some friends who are living in a huge villa in the middle of Berlin. Inside there were "millions" of people we don't even know but overall we had an amazing night. The poor thing: That was the party. I mean THE PARTY. It’ll never happen again to anyone of us.

### February
After my birthday I visited my aunt and uncle to have a cup of coffee and introduce them to my girlfriend. My aunt was curious about my hobby speedcubing, so I told her about it. We got to the point that the world championship of speedcubing will take place in summer in Las Vegas. I was a little bit sad, because I can not be there (I already missed the world championship in bangkok 2011). Right before we left my aunt told me, that she would love to support me and split the cost of the journey to Las Vegas. I was happy as hell and couldn't believe what just happened.
A few days after this meeting I was discovered by a guy living in Vegas. We were on the same penpal community and he noticed my hobby and that I’m coming to his city. We became really good penpals and he told me I could stay at his house for the 10 days in summer. Again I couldn't believe that this is happening to me. I get back to this point later.

### May
I guess it was May. My best friend Kevin and I met [Tim](http://timpietrusky.com) for the first time, he's also a web developer and living near us. Meanwhile we're good friends and Kevin is working for his company. This contact is very special to us because we three and some other guys from [Codepen](http://codepen.io) started a small dev group as you can see on my about page. The group is growing and growing. All of us gained so much experience and improved our skills to a pretty high level in such a short time. To start/join this group was one of the best decisions in 2013. Viva la [bullgit](http://bullg.it) (That’s the name of our group...)! To keep growing we're planning some hack days in the future. Once this topic is getting serious I'll write something about it on this website. Bullgit is all about bullg... shit.

### June
My apprenticeship ended and I was looking for a new company in [Mayence](http://goo.gl/maps/AZIoI) because I wanted to move to this city. I've never planned to live in this city and I had no clue if there are companies I'd love to work with. Anyway, after a couple of google searches I discovered [Opoloo](http://opoloo.com) and dropped them a mail. They replied very quickly and invited me to their office.
I was able to do a internship and told that they’re interested in my skills. Ok, so I had a new job right after my journey to Las Vegas.

### July
My internship ended and I packed my stuff to fly half around the globe. That one morning I realized:”Dude! In a few hours I’m going to be inside a plane flying to Sin City...”. I was so excited, I almost fainted. Departure was on 25th July and I arrived 12 hours later. My friend Lucas (the one from Vegas) picked me up at the airport and we were walking to the garage. Suddenly that one last door opened and I made my first step outside the airport. OMG. It was so fucking hot. I mean about 50°C/122°F. And it was dry as hell. I thought, that I couldn’t survive for 10 days but I did. It sounds really hot and that’s exactly what it feels like but you can handle it pretty good after a while.
It would take too much time to tell you everything of my journey, so here’s a video. Enjoy.

### August
I came back from Las Vegas and started work at Opoloo. Two days after my arrival I also moved to Mayence together with my girlfriend. Finally I was really happy with my recent decisions. Job at an amazing company, fancy new apartment and vison for better times. Felt like I’m finally home.

### September
My boss asked me to join a meet up in London with [Novoda](http://novoda.com), a high level android development company based in my very favorite city. I couldn’t say no, because I was really excited to meet these guys and I wanted to go to London again. So we’ve been there for 3 days, worked at the Novoda office, exchanged experience and also had some beer at a really nice pub nearby the office. It was something between holiday and work. It was as it should be anytime.

### November
Nothing special happened between September and December. I really wanted to redesign my website but couldn’t think of anything cool. This was probably the worst time in 2013 for me. After ~~some~~ a lot of scratches I finally designed my new website. I’m still very proud of it but... I’m a web-developer... I always think of something new. So maybe this site will be updated again in the near future.

### December
I discovered a development conference in Paris and told Tim about it. He wanted to go there but only if I join and we could find a place to stay in Paris. We were lucky because [Lucas](http://lucasbonomi.com), one of our bullgit team, is living in Paris and he said it would be okay to stay at his apartment for that weekend. So Tim and I drove to Paris with my companies car and went to that conference together with Lucas. This was also the first time we both met him in real life. He’s a cool and smart person, we’re happy to have him on board at bullgit.

Overall that’s it. I proudly look back to the year 2013. It was one of the best years I ever had. 2014 will hopefully be even better. A lot travels are planned, so I guess it won’t be a boring year. I wish you all a great 2k14!
