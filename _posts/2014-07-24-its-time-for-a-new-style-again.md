A little while ago I came up with version 10 of this website. I'm still pretty satisfied but it grinds my peaches that it's still not finished. The worst part: <a href="/lab">The lab</a>. I really need to fix this, so I can show a little bit more of my work.

I'll try to do this asap. Asap always means "Something between now and (current year + 7)".
