The recent weeks I struggeled with a couple of new designs for my website. I started work for version 9 of MyXoToD.com and at first I was really satisfied but after some days I kicked the whole thing right into the bin.

I placed a maintenance message on my domain and that was it. Couldn't believe. It's like that every fucking time when I start to redesign my website. I could be the worst customer ever. Especially to myself. Anyway, I proceeded to get inspired and build something cool.

And here it is! I'm proud to present the new design of my website. There's also another small point on my list: This site is now accessable with **.de** and **.com**

This time I don't use an own system or Wordpress, I use [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com). It's a pretty simple but awesome ruby gem, you should check it out!
