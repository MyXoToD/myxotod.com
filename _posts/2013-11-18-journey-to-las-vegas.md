I used to go to a lot of speedcubing competitions around Europe, especially Germany but I've never been out of Europe for this. In summer 2013 I went to Las Vegas, my first time in America, to participate at the world championship of speedcubing. The whole journey was worth every single cent I spent!

The best part, two of my penpals are living in Las Vegas, so I was able to meet them :) One of them gave me shelter for 10 days, so I skipped the hotel fees.

To get a better idea of my trip to Sin City, watch the video ;)
