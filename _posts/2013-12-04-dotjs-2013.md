It's been a while since my last development conference. I was lucky to get one of the last *super-late bird tickets* for the [dotJS](http://dotjs.eu) conference in Paris, France. As the predicts, it's all about javascript and similar web-technologies. [Tim](http://www.timpietrusky.com) and I have teamed up and went to Paris together to meet [Lucas](http://lucasbonomi.com) for the first time and of course the conference.

Blablabla tbc..
