It's been a while since my last development conference. I was lucky to get one of the last *super-late bird tickets* for the [dotJS](http://dotjs.eu) conference in Paris, France. As it predicts, it's all about javascript and similar web-technologies. [Tim](http://www.timpietrusky.com) and I have teamed up and went to Paris together to meet [Lucas](http://lucasbonomi.com) for the first time and of course to go to that conference.

I recently got a new Alcatel phone with FirefoxOS, to test it and see how the app development is working. After a couple of days I was really excited about this operation system, because the app development is really easy for web developers. I love it! Then I noticed that the CTO of Mozilla is going to talk live on stage at the dotJS conference, that was the main point for me to go to that event. Unfortunately he didn't talked that much about the app developement on the new OS :(

Anyway, there were a lot of cool guys with interesting presentations and we all had a lot of fun. I explored tons of new topics to check out afterwards. Also the venue was pretty awesome. It was the theatre of paris, which looks pretty expensive to me. It was a little bit small for the huge amount of people in there but it was still a cool place for this kind of event.

All of the main speakers had 20 minutes for their presentations, but 5 speakers (non of the main speakers) got 4 minute talks. I liked these short talks pretty much. The best part: My good friend Tim was one of those 4 minute speakers. He talked about "[Synchronize CSS animations with HTML5 audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsNnNL0MV4o)", you should definitely check it out. He also had the talk with the most laughers :D

At the end of the event the host revealed, that there would be a new conference in 2014, the dotCSS. This is so awesome! I'll try to speak on that conference next year. And I'll try to attend at the dotJS 2014 again.
